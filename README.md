An exercise to learn C# by converting existing Serenity project to C-Sharp

This project helped me learn MVC and C-Sharp by taking an existing project I had worked on in Python/Django and convert it to C-Sharp. 

Future iterations will add other existing modules currently found in the Python/Django version of Serenity.
